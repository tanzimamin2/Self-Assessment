# Self-Assessment

## My Role
I oversaw the presentation for our group, but I helped wherever I was needed. I helped with our ML models (Sentiment analysis), Database (EDA for datasets) and Github Readme.
Visualizations is one aspect I did not get involved with, but I was always present for all discussions and provided feedback whenever I could.

To expand on my contributions, I performed EDA for our initial Kaggle datasets. Unfortunately, after the EDA we all concluded that our Kaggle dataset was very inconsistent and unreliable. As such, we scrapped all those datasets and EDAs.

For ML, I started work on a Sentiment Analysis system for analyzing user reviews. The idea was for our ML model to go through all user reviews and give them a ‘Positive’ or ‘Negative’ verdict. I used the Textblob library to find out the ‘Subjectivity’ and ‘Polarity’ for the reviews and give us a sentiment analysis.

I also helped update the Github Readme from time to time.

## Personal Challenge
Luckily, I did not face any personal challenges but if I had to pick something it would be time. It was a challenge to accomplish so much in a short period of time. But I always had my team to help me as well as our very supportive TA.
